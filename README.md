# SVM-classification-model-to-predict-fetal-health-with-the-result-of-a-CTG-exam
Objectives of the practical • Preprocessing a dataset • Achieve to do an SVM “by hand” • Use R packages to build an SVM model • Step-by-step machine learning modelisation
In this practical session, we will use the Fetal health classification dataset from Ayres de Campos et al. (2000)
SisPorto 2.0 A Program for Automated Analysis of Cardiotocograms. J Matern Fetal Med 5:311-318.
## Context
Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and
is a key indicator of human progress. The UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of
newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under-5 mortality to at least
as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for 295,000 deaths
during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred
in low-ressource settings, and most could have been prevented.
In light of what was mentioned above, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option
to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal
mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding
light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterin contractions and more.
